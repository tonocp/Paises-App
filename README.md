# PaisesApp

This is the GitHub repository for this project I made for searching _Countries_ by _Name, Capital, Region, etc..._ based on **Angular** and **Bootstrap**, using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) for queries.

**Now it's deployed here https://paises-app-tcp.netlify.app/**
