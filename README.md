# PaisesApp

This is the GitHub repository for this project I made. It's a **Single Page Application** Website for searching *Countries* by *Name, Capital, Region, etc...* based on **Angular** and using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/).

**Now it's deployed here https://paises-app-tcp.netlify.app/**
